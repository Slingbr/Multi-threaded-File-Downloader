Multi-Threaded File Downloader (Java)
This is a Java project I built to download files faster using multi-threading. Instead of downloading a file from start to finish with one connection, this breaks the file into chunks and downloads them in parallel using multiple threads.


How It Works
You provide a file URL and an output path

The program checks if the server supports Range requests

If supported, it splits the file into parts and starts a thread for each chunk

Once all threads finish, it merges everything into a complete file

Features
Multi-threaded file download using Java’s core libraries

Detects and handles servers that support partial content

Can  handle large files

Lightweight and focused on performance

Things To Know
Defaults to using 8 threads — you can change that in the code

If the server doesn’t support range-based downloads, it’ll just fall back to single-threaded

Doesn’t currently support download resume or retries (might add later)

Why I Made It
Wanted to get more hands-on with Java networking and threading, and this seemed like a practical way to put those concepts to use. Also helps show how a simple idea can be made way more efficient with concurrency.
